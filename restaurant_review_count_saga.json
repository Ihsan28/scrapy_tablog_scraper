What kind of yakitori can I eat?\nA. Local chickens make up about 1% of the chickens in Japan, and among them, Miyazaki Jidori chickens are raised stress-free by trusted contracted chicken farmers for more than three times the usual time. They are simply grilled over charcoal to bring out the sweetness and umami of the high-quality fat. However, if you have budget or price restrictions, we recommend that you consider other stores or services that fit your price range. Thank you for your understanding.\n\nQ2 Are there private rooms?\nA. We have one private room. To use the private room, a private room fee of 500 yen will be charged per person. Please choose from the standard course or premium course. After ordering the course, you can also order from the a la carte menu.\n\nQ3: We may decline your reservation even if you make one.\n・To ensure that you can enjoy the atmosphere of the restaurant, please refrain from talking loudly. Please be considerate of other customers."}]}, "review_count": 197, "url": "https://tabelog.com/en/tokyo/A1303/A130301/13245796/"}
